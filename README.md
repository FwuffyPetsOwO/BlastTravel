### Getting Started

![Cannon Recipe](./img/recipe.png)
<br/><br/>

**Prepare the cannon:** <br/> <br/>
![Cannon UI](./img/cannon_ui.png)
- Sneak + interact with (shift-right-click on) the cannon to open its UI
- Add gunpowder to the first slot (more will fire farther and faster)
- Add chains to the second slot to *lock the cannon*
- Add a decoration block (gold, moss) to the third slot, or optionally add alternative ammunition (tnt, anvils)
<br/><br/>

**Fire the cannon:** <br/>
![Player In Cannon](./img/in_cannon.png)
- Enter the cannon by interacting with (right-clicking on) it
- If the cannon is not chained, look around to aim the cannon
- Jump (press space) while inside the cannon to fire
- If you would like to fire something else (alternative ammunition, or another player), power the cannon with redstone
